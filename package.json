  "description": "A secure and user-friendly system for user registration, login, and authorization is implemented in this project. Users can sign up, log in, and access protected resources after proper authentication. The login process is designed to be secure, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information, while the user registration process gathers necessary information, validates it, and stores it in a secure Postgres database. The system implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as the bearer token and uses an authorization middleware to ensure that users only have access to resources they are authorized to see. The application is dockerized for ease of deployment and management.",
